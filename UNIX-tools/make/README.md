Make supports variables to ease writing makefiles. They are assigned with
one of the following operators: `=`, `?=`, `:=`, `::=`, `+=`, `!=`.
The difference between them is the following:

* `=` assigns a deferred value to a variable. That means that value of the
variable will be computed every time variable is used. Be aware of that
 when assigning the result of shell commandâ€”shell command will be executed
 every time variable is read.

* `:=` and `::=` are essentially the same. Such assignment computes variable value once and just stores it. Simple and powerful. This type of assignment should be your default choice.

* `?=` works as `:=` if the variable was not defined, otherwise does nothing
. `+=` is append operator. The right-hand side is considered immediate if
 the variable was previously set with `:=` or `::=`, and deferred otherwise.
`!=` is a shell assignment operator. The right-hand side is evaluated immediately and handed to the shell. The result is stored in the variable named on the left.
