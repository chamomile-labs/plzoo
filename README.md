a zoo for programming languages

> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.
> <br>*- Alan Perlis*, from his [epigrams](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html)

this is meant to be a casual environment to learn and experiment with various languages

resources and assorted details for each language are in their respective READMEs
