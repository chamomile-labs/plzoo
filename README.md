a zoo for programming languages

> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.
> <br>*- Alan Perlis*, from his [epigrams](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html)

this is meant to be a casual environment to learn and experiment with various languages

resources and assorted details for each language are in their respective READMEs

## Stuff
* "The task of the programming language designer "is consolidation not innovation". (Hoare, 1973).
* "Symmetry is a complexity-reducing concept (co-routines include subroutines); seek it everywhere." (Perlis)
* "Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it." (Perlis)
* "Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to see it as a soap bubble?"
