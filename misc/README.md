## misc notes

- orthogonality

Edsger Dijkstra: Art and Science of PLs
Donald Knuth: Analysis of Algorithms and Design of PLs
Michael Rabin and Dana Scott: Nondeterministic machines
John Backus: PL Specification (grammars)
Robert Floyd: Formal Semantics, PL verification/synthesis
Kenneth Iverson: APL, PL theory and pratice
        - when all you have is a hammar everything looks like a nail
Tony Hoare: Hoare logic, CSP, other PL topics
Niklaus Wirth : ALGOL, Euler, Modula, Pascal
John Cocke: Optimizing Compilers (and RISC)
Robin Milner: LCS, ML (language), CCS, formal semantics

Alan Kay: Object Oriented PLs

```

Why PLs matter
- some languages foster better software (less bugs,cleaner, more secure, etc)
- sapir-whorf hypothess (lingustics): language structure determines our thought process
	+ Iverson: Notation as a Tool of Thought
- chomsky, grammar, innate language for humans
- Efficiency: programmer efficiency, translation (compile), execution (runtime, memory)

## SNOBOL

## BLISS

BLISS is an "expression language" rather than a "statement language".

This means that every construct of the language that is not a declaration is an expression.
