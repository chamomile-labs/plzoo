> Thus in assigning credit for the development of logic programming, the French can point to Prolog's genesis at the University of Marseille, While the British can highlight the work at the University of Edinburgh. According to people at MIT, logic programming was developed at these groups in an attempt to figure out what Hewitt was talking about in his brilliant, but impenetrable Ph.D thesis. For a history of logic programming see Robinson 1983.
